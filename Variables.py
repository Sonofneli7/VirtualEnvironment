# Notes
    # Variables: Store data the app uses
    # Var: Name for memory location to store and manipulate values: saved in RAM memory
        # Example: In file `converter.py`
        # Input: Distance in miles: 10
        # Output: 10.0 miles = 16.09 km
        # "miles" is the variable
    # Immutable vars: Changing stored value affects the original variable
